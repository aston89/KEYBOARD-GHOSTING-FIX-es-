## 1a. Introduction

Mechanical keyboards, especially those running at high polling rates (1000 Hz or above), offer extremely fast and precise input. However, they can also expose subtle issues within the Windows input stack that lead to “ghosting”, unintended or spurious key events that confuse the system and cause erratic behavior.

---

## 1b. Symptoms

Users experiencing this issue typically report:
- Random or stuck **WinKey activation**, causing the Start Menu to open unexpectedly.  
- Intermittent **ghosted keypresses** or repeated inputs that don’t correspond to actual physical key activity.  
- Problems more common in browsers and traditional desktop apps that rely on standard Windows keyboard input.  
- Games that use RawInput or DirectInput bypass the problem entirely, explaining why these glitches do not appear in most modern titles.

## 2. Understanding "KeyboardDataQueueSize" and the Myth of Latency

The KeyboardDataQueueSize registry flag defines the size of the FIFO buffer used by kbdclass.sys, the Windows keyboard class driver. When left on automatic (default), Windows dynamically sizes the buffer based on outdated assumptions, typically expecting a 125Hz polling rate like legacy PS/2 office keyboards.

On modern mechanical keyboards running at 1000Hz polling rate, this auto-sizing becomes buggy, windows thinks it's a PS/2 keyboard and set a wrong value. The buffer can overflow or drop events, especially under fast or repeated keystrokes, causing ghosting, stuck keys, or phantom modifiers like WinKey triggering on its own.

Despite common gaming folklore, increasing this buffer size does not add latency. It's just a bigger pipe, not a slower one. The myth likely came from gamers misinterpreting responsiveness with overflow delays caused by a buffer too small. Ironically, setting it lower "for gaming" increases the chance of input corruption.

Increasing the buffer (e.g., to a fixed value 128 decimal) ensures headroom without affecting latency or input precision it's a safety margin, not a throttle.

## 3. Different Types of Keyboard Input and Why Ghosting Differs in Games

Standard Windows Input (kbdclass.sys + User32 API):
This is the classic keyboard input pipeline used by most desktop applications, browsers, editors, and IDEs. Input events pass through the kernel driver’s buffer and accessibility filters, which can introduce ghosting or stuck keys if misconfigured.

RawInput / DirectInput / XInput (Common in Games):
Many modern games bypass the standard Windows keyboard queue by reading input directly from the hardware device via these APIs. This direct access avoids most software filters, buffering quirks, and accessibility layers, greatly reducing ghosting and input anomalies.

Because of this, the ghosting and input glitches described in this guide mainly affect users who type fast in traditional desktop environments, such as programmers, writers, or anyone working extensively in browsers and editors. Games that use RawInput or similar APIs typically do not exhibit these problems, which explains why some users never see ghosting during gameplay but experience it heavily during fast typing.

## 4. The Hidden Culprit: Accessibility Flags That Stay Active (Even When You Think They're Off)

Windows includes several built-in accessibility features like StickyKeys, FilterKeys, BounceKeys, and SlowKeys originally designed to help users with motor impairments. However, these features can remain partially active at the driver level even if they appear disabled in the Control Panel or Settings UI.

One critical registry path is:
HKCU\Control Panel\Accessibility\Keyboard Response
Inside this key:
The Flags DWORD controls whether filtering behavior is enabled.
Even when all individual delay/repeat values are set to 0 (disabled), a non-zero Flags value can silently activate input filtering.
This filtering can interfere with rapid key sequences, sometimes introducing artificial key repeats, phantom key releases, or delayed inputs i.e., exactly the kind of ghosting and glitching issues fast typists encounter.

Why It Happens Silently:
Windows Updates or system repairs can occasionally reset this flag or preserve it across reinstalls without user consent.
No clear UI toggle exists for fully disabling this behavior at the driver level; only registry-level edits work.

Check registry key for hidden accessibility flag :

powershell : 
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Control Panel\Accessibility\Keyboard Response" -Name "Flags"

regedit : 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\Keyboard Response
Flags keyword must be zero to ensure filtering is truly disabled.

## 5. keyboardfilter.sys: The Silent Hardware Filter You (Probably) Don’t Need

keyboardfilter.sys is a Windows driver designed for security lockdown scenarios, most commonly found in:
    Kiosk systems
    POS terminals
    Enterprise-managed environments
    Secure boot configurations
    Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) lockdown profiles

This driver allows administrators to block or remap specific keys at a very low level, even before the standard kbdclass.sys processes the input.

Why It’s Useless (or Harmful) for Gamers and Developers:
For everyday users, especially gamers, developers, or fast typists, keyboardfilter does nothing beneficial and can introduce:
    Unpredictable key handling behavior
    Dropped or reordered keystrokes
    Conflicts with mechanical keyboards using high polling rates (500Hz–1000Hz)

Moreover, it runs silently in the background if ever enabled it has no user interface, no control panel, and doesn’t always show up in the Device Manager.
It must be manually disabled or removed using "sc delete keyboardfilter" (from cmd with admin privilege)
or via Group Policy / Registry depending on how it was deployed.

Even after removing the service a virtual HID device may still linger in your system, acting as a proxy or filter for your physical keyboard and potentially interfering with normal input : Device Manager / Keyboards / "Keyboard Filter Device" (or similar).

This virtual device doesn’t correspond to a physical port, it’s an abstract layer used by the OS to intercept and manage keystrokes before they reach kbdclass.sys
It can remain silently active even when the service has been deleted.
It may reappear after system updates or on reboot, depending on the policy state.
It contributes to ghosting, input lag, or inexplicable modifier behavior on high-speed mechanical keyboards.

The virtual keyboard filter device can’t be disabled manually from Device Manager, the option is greyed out or blocked due to system protections.
However, you can force-disable it via the registry by targeting the device’s specific instance path.

check for the the properties, read the hardware ID, look it in the registry under : 
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\HID"

check for the matching vendor id and add this keyword : 
"ConfigFlags"=dword:00000001
(this will disable the virtual keyboardfilter hardware)

## 6. Preventing USB Polling Rate Drifting and Power Management workarounds to reduce input lag

Windows may degrade performance or introduce input delay due to aggressive power management features. To maintain stable performance, it's essential to disable USB selective suspend and related options in both system-wide settings and device-level flags.
(These two workarounds have low to negligible impact on energy saving)

### Disable "USB Selective Suspend" 
Open an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
powercfg -attributes SUB_USB 2a737441-1930-4402-8d77-b2bebba308a3 -ATTRIB_HIDE
(This command unhides the USB selective suspend setting under your active power plan.)

Go to Control Panel - Power Options.
Click on your active plan - "Change plan settings" - "Change advanced power settings".
Expand USB settings - USB selective suspend setting.
Set both On battery and Plugged in to Disabled.

This prevents the OS from pausing or lowering polling rates on idle HID/USB devices, which is critical for mechanical keyboards at 1000Hz. 

### Disable “Allow the computer to turn off this device” 
In addition to global settings, Windows can suspend USB input devices individually using a per-device setting. This can lead to erratic behavior like missed keystrokes or polling rate degradation.

Open Device Manager - Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers or Human Interface Devices.
Right-click your keyboard or relevant USB Input Device - Properties.
Go to the Power Management tab (if it doesnt exist, skip).
Uncheck: “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power”
(Repeat this for every USB device your keyboard might enumerate as (HID-compliant device, composite USB device, etc.)

Disabling these settings ensures constant power and polling stability, preventing Windows from interfering silently with your device's real-time communication.

p.s. you will still be able to suspend your pc, this settings is "ambiguous" and many people believe it causes problems on stand-by)

## 7. Other Potential Causes and Considerations

While this guide focuses on core Windows-level causes of ghosting and input issues on high-polling mechanical keyboards, several other factors can contribute to or exacerbate problems:

NKRO (N-Key Rollover) support and layers: Some keyboards use complex firmware layers or emulation modes that may interact oddly with Windows, especially if layers like NKRO or Fn key mappings are not properly handled. Disabling or toggling these layers can affect input reliability.

Multiple HID devices for the same keyboard: Some keyboards expose multiple device interfaces (e.g., a separate HID for media keys, macro buttons, or lighting control). If these additional devices are not disabled or managed correctly, they can cause input conflicts or unexpected behavior.

Third-party software and filters: Software like key loggers, input remappers, antivirus tools, or keyboard customization utilities (e.g., AutoHotkey, gaming suites) may install hooks or filters that interfere with raw input processing, causing latency or ghosting effects.

## 8. 5KRO & 6KRO vs NKRO: Why "Less" Is Sometimes Better

Most modern mechanical keyboards advertise NKRO (N-Key Rollover), which theoretically allows you to press an unlimited number of keys simultaneously without ghosting or blocking. However, in practice, 6KRO (6Key+1modifier) or even 5KRO (5key+2modifier) modes are often more stable and efficient, especially under Windows.

Why?

USB Bandwidth & Grouping: USB keyboards typically transmit key events in grouped fixed size frame reports. NKRO on USB often relies on tricks like multiple HID interfaces with special protocols which can lead to inconsistencies or even ghosting when improperly handled by drivers or the OS (the higher the polling rate, the more it could happen).

Latency vs Complexity: Simpler rollover modes (5KRO-6KRO) reduce the overhead involved in interpreting input matrices and avoid driver-level hacks. This can improve latency and minimize error in high-polling-rate environments.

Real-World Use Cases: Even in demanding games like StarCraft II, it's rare to press more than 6 keys + modifiers at the exact same time. Unless you're using macros or complex chorded inputs, NKRO is generally overkill.

Fallback Mode Benefits: Many high-end keyboards allow a switch back to 6KRO or 5+2 mode. This fallback can help ensure cleaner input parsing, especially on systems where compatibility, input stability, or fast typing are priorities (e.g., for coders, writers, or competitive gamers avoiding bloated input stacks).

Unless your use case explicitly needs extreme input concurrency, 5KRO/6KRO base mode on NKRO offers a safer, faster, and more consistent user experience, particularly when paired with a high polling rate and disabling the additional filtering layers.

## 9. EXTRA step : Set TextInputHost.exe to High Priority at User Logon

Windows dynamically adjusts CPU scheduling between foreground and background processes, often assigning a much smaller time quantum to background tasks to save energy.
This aggressive prioritization can reduce CPU time for input-related processes like TextInputHost.exe, causing input lag or glitches.
Forcing TextInputHost.exe to run at high priority ensures it receives adequate CPU scheduling time despite these system default optimizations. (alternatively you can check "[melody tweaker](https://github.com/SheMelody/melodys-tweaker/releases)" on github for more info on how to tweak scheduling and ratio's)

## 10. Problem still persists? Check the keyboard:

If you've already applied the software tweaks but the issue occasionally returns, the root cause might be **mechanical resonance or switch-level defects**.  
Here’s a checklist of keyboard hardware-related factors to consider:

- **Switch resonance:**  
  Some mechanical switches, especially *unlubricated linear or tactile types*, can resonate like a drum when keys are pressed rapidly.  
  This is more common in switches with **nylon housings** or loose stems. (Hot swap socket loose, pin on switch half broken etc etc)

- **Echo chamber under keys:**  
  Large keys like the spacebar or Winkey may sit above a hollow gap in the PCB or case. This space can amplify internal vibrations and cause unintended signals.  (In this case, its more likely an half-broken metal contact broken inside the switch that still work)
  *Fix: add dampening foam (e.g., Poron, silicone) under the keycap or inside the housing.*

- **Defective or misaligned switches:**  
  Occasionally, a single faulty switch may produce **phantom keypresses** due to a worn contact leaf or irregular stem movement.  
  *Fix: replace with a higher-tolerance or heavier switch (e.g., POM/Nylon mix).*

- **Lack or excess of lubrication:**  
  Dry or drenched switches can create micro-friction or spring recoil artifacts detectable by sensitive firmware.  
  *Fix: switch to pre-lubed silent variants or apply controlled lubing (only if you're experienced).*

- **Keycap fit & acoustic feedback:**  
  Loose or poorly fitted keycaps can amplify vibration or transmit it across the plate.  
  *Fix: use keycaps with snug cross-stem fitting or add dampening o-rings if needed.*

- **Actuation weight matters:**  
  Avoid ultra-light actuation switches on high-risk keys (like Winkey or spacebar).  
  *Heavier switches offer better mechanical isolation and reduce false activations due to micro-oscillations.*

## 11. Problem still persists? Check your hardware (peripherals and more):

- **Bridged PCI/PCIe Sound Cards**
Creative Sound Blaster (especially X-Fi, Audigy with PCI bridging or legacy emulation)
Some ASUS Essence or other PCIe cards with multiple controllers that interfere with shared IRQs
Typical issue: drivers holding IRQ lines even when disabled → unstable NKRO/6KRO, key jitter

- **External USB Controllers or PCI USB Hubs**
Older PCIe USB 3.0 hubs or non-certified hubs → selective suspend and polling issues
USB expansion cards with VIA/NEC/Fresco Logic chips that poorly handle the host controller
Symptom: mechanical keyboards miss keystrokes during fast combos or intensive macros

- **Graphics Cards with Aggressive Passthrough or Overlay Software**
Older AMD/NVIDIA GPUs using DirectInput/RawInput hooks (e.g., Radeon Overlay, RivaTuner, Steam Overlay)
Problem: input can conflict with app-level reading → ghosting or dropped keys in some apps

- **PCIe Capture/Acquisition Cards**
Elgato HD60/HD60 Pro, some Blackmagic Decklink cards
High-polling drivers or aggressive IRQ handling may “steal” interrupts from HID devices

- **Legacy PS/2 Controllers & Hybrid Keyboards**
PS/2 keyboards with USB adapters → some Intel ICH/AMD southbridge controllers mishandle rollover above 6KRO
Symptom: lost key combinations, ghosting, or “jumping” input

- **Virtual Input-Handling Devices or Gaming Software**
Keyboards and gaming peripherals using Razer Synapse, Logitech Gaming Software, Corsair iCUE
Virtual drivers intercepting input may cause conflicts in non-standard applications

- **Legacy PCIe Network Cards (Wi-Fi / LAN)**
Older Intel/Realtek NICs or beta drivers generating interrupt storms under load
Symptom: high IRQ load → dropped keystrokes on high-polling mechanical keyboards

> **Note:** Any PCI/PCIe device generating high interrupts or using shared buses can interfere with high-priority input devices. The X-Fi (emu20k2) is the most well-known case up to date expecially under win10 22h2 and upper (completely broken drivers), but these other hardware types can cause similar issues.
> These hardware tweaks, combined with software-side priority adjustments and input filtering, can dramatically improve stability on high-polling-rate keyboards.
